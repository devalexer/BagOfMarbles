# BagOfMarbles

This was a homework assignment for The Iron Yard to practice JQuery and AJAX by creating bag of marbles 'game'.

### REQUIREMENTS

- Create an app for a bag of marbles

This API has two endpoints:
- Return a random marble
- Add a marble to the bag

NOTE: Marbles should be stored in a static list in the controller, not in the database.

On index.cshtml
- add a button that gets a marble and, using jquery, displays a random marble
- add a text box & a button that allows the user to add a new marble to the bag of marbles
